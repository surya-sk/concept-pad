<h2>Concept Pad</h2>

Concept Pad is a simple application that helps you jot down game concepts and ap ideas instantly. Using a text editor for those can get messy, and that's where this app comes in. The app lets you quickly create concepts, edit them, delete them and even share them with other people. 

The app is available to download for Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile and Windows 11.
